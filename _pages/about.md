Hello! I am a research engineer at Apple (Video Engineering). I like to work on problems at the intersection of computer vision, information theory and data compression. 

## Education

I did my undergrad from IIT Bombay, and my PhD from Stanford under the guidance of [Prof. Tsachy Weissman](https://web.stanford.edu/~tsachy/). I worked at [WaveOne inc](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/27/apple-acquired-a-startup-using-ai-to-compress-videos/), a startup working on ML-based compression before working at Apple. 

I also served as an Adjunct Professor at Stanford while designing and teaching the course [EE274: Data Compression](https://stanforddatacompressionclass.github.io/Fall22/). 

## Research

Although most of recent work is at industry and hence not public, you can take a look at some of my past work here:

1. [google scholar link](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RU0ZAp4AAAAJ&hl=en)
2. [github link](https://github.com/kedartatwawadi)

## Software

Here are some softwares I helped write/create
1.  [Stanford Compression Library](https://github.com/kedartatwawadi/stanford_compression_library): a simple python package designed for educational reasons, while teaching the [EE274: Data Compression](https://stanforddatacompressionclass.github.io/Fall22/)course at Stanford. 
2. [Spring compressor](https://github.com/shubhamchandak94/Spring): A no-reference compressor for FASTQ genomic data. 
3. [DeepZip](https://github.com/kedartatwawadi/NN_compression): A somewhat old work which used RNNs for lossless compression.
