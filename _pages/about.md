Hi! I am a ML Researcher at Apple in the Video Engineering. Perviously I was a Research  Scientist at [WaveOne Inc.](). At WaveOne I worked on designing ML-based image compression methods. [Here is a link to our compression method](https://wave-one.github.io/iframe_comparisons/) from more than a year back which did more than 2x better than state-of-the-art compression methods Previously I completed my PhD in Electrical Engineering at Stanford in 2020 (and MS in 2017), advised by [Prof. Tsachy Weissman](). I like working on problems related to Machine Learning and Data Compression. 

I am currently co-teaching the course [EE274: Data Compression, Theory and Applications](https://stanforddatacompressionclass.github.io/Fall22/) at Stanford University!
