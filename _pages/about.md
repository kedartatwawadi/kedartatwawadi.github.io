Hi! I am a ML Researcher at Apple in the Video Engineering. My current research interests includes Image/Video AI-based compression and generative AI. Perviously I was a Research Scientist at [WaveOne Inc.](). At WaveOne I worked on designing ML-based image compression methods. [Here is a link to our compression method](https://wave-one.github.io/iframe_comparisons/) from more than a year back which did more than 2x better than state-of-the-art compression methods. 

Previously I completed my PhD in Electrical Engineering at Stanford in 2020 (and MS in 2017), advised by [Prof. Tsachy Weissman](). 

Along with research, I am passionate about teaching and writing! I co-taught the course [EE274: Data Compression, Theory and Applications](https://stanforddatacompressionclass.github.io/Fall22/) at Stanford University in 2022.
