Hi! I am a Research  Scientist at [WaveOne Inc.](). Previously I completed my PhD in Electrical Engineering at Stanford in 2020 (and MS in 2017), advised by [Prof. Tsachy Weissman](). I like working on problems related to Machine Learning and Data Compression. 

I am currently co-teaching the course [EE274: Data Compression, Theory and Applications](https://stanforddatacompressionclass.github.io/Fall22/) at Stanford University!
